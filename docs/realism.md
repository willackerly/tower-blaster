# Photoreal look (`real`)

Design doc with costs and alternatives: https://claude.ai/artifact/DtEnSG7b8KVNRcYfZ8L78u
(thread "Make the world look photoreal", 2026-10-26). This file records the
rules the code follows; the doc has the reasoning.

## Rules

- `real` is a look preset (`LOOKS.real`, `?look=real`), not a fork of the renderer.
- **Existing looks stay bit-identical.** `render.test.ts` pins FNV hashes of
  `candy` and `hazy` frames (`test/golden/looks.json`, per platform key). Realism
  code lives in a second build of the scene shader (`sceneWgsl(true)`) whose
  pipelines only looks with an `atmosphere` use, and its resources live in
  their own bind group (group 1). Changing a pinned hash takes
  `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 pnpm test packages/render/test/render.test.ts -t golden`
  and a reason in the commit message.
- **Cost target** (M5 Max, 2560x1440, `pnpm bench:render`): `real` at most
  +1.0 ms over `full` at 100k cubes far view, +0.5 ms at 10k. Every expensive
  feature gets a paired bench variant that switches it off.
- **No downloaded assets.** Materials are baked on the GPU at startup into
  texture arrays; the arrays can take CC0 scans later without shader changes.
- Each physical model has a CPU twin compared with the GPU result in tests.
- **Knobs, not constants.** Every choice a scene might change (sun, haze,
  ground, exposure, materials) is a `RealOptions` field with a default in
  `REAL_DEFAULTS`, reachable from URL params and the viewer's Scene panel.
- No stylized effects: `real` sets `effects: false` (no sparks, ball trail,
  heat glow or point lights); impact dust replaces them in step 6.

## What step 1 built

- `atmosphere.ts`: Hillaire 2020 LUTs (transmittance 256x64, multiple
  scattering 32x32, sky view 192x108, all rgba16float). Transmittance and
  multiple scattering rerun only when haze or ground albedo change; the sky
  view and the ambient pass run every frame (they follow the sun and eye
  height). Geometry is written in heights (r^2 - Rg^2 = h(2Rg + h)) so f32
  keeps its precision 2 m above the ground.
- Aerial perspective reads the sky view LUT along the view ray and scales its
  in-scattering by the optical depth covered; the sky disc is limb-darkened.
- Ambient until step 2: the cosine-weighted mean sky radiance and the
  ground's radiance (csAmbient, one workgroup, fixed summation order).
- Exposure adapts (`autoExposure`, 0 to 1, default 0.75) to an incident-light
  dome reading: sun / 4 + (sky + ground) / 2. csAmbient computes it and the
  frame copies it into the post uniform on the GPU timeline, so no readback.
  `ADAPT_REF` is the reading at the default sun, so the default exposure
  holds there.

## Steps

1. Golden gate; sun direction as a look parameter; `real` scaffold and bench variant; Hillaire 2020 atmosphere (sky, haze, sun colour).
2. Sky lighting: SH irradiance, prefiltered cubemap, ground bounce.
3. Cube materials: baked texture arrays, per-cube variation, edge wear, dirt.
4. Ground material, anti-tiling, near parallax, horizon.
5. Soft shadows: PCSS with the sun's 0.53 degree diameter.
6. Dust and chips instead of sparks and heat glow.
7. Polish: steel ball, grain, tone-map A/B, tuning from Mac screenshots.
